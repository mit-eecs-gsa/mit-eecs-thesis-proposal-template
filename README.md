# MIT Thesis Proposal Template

This is a thesis proposal template for the MIT EECS Department. It is targeted at the S.M.
Thesis but should work for the Ph.D. Thesis as well by substituting values.

## Write content

- edit the main `Thesis_Proposal.tex` as you see fit
- edit the titlepage `titlepage.tex`
- create content in `abstract.tex`, `intro.tex`, `procedure.tex`, and `references.bib`, or
    modify as you see fit

## Compile document

- compile with `make main` (requires `latexmk` to be installed), or modify to use your own
    build tools as you prefer
